## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a potential security vulnerability in AuditFlow, please help us fix it by reporting it privately. You can send an email to **[YOUR_EMAIL_HERE]**.

### What to include:
* A description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue (PoC).
* Potential impact if exploited.

### Our Response
We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix if the vulnerability is confirmed. We request that you do not disclose the issue publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Security Audit
As AuditFlow is a tool designed for compliance, we aim for "Security-by-Design." However, during this **Alpha Phase**, the tool should be used for testing and development environments rather than as the sole source of truth for production compliance.
