# Contributing to AuditFlow 

Thank you for your interest in helping us bridge the gap between engineering and compliance! We welcome contributions from DevOps engineers, Security Architects, and Mathematics/CS researchers.

## How You Can Contribute

### 1. Technical Development
We are currently building the core scanning engine. We need help with:
* **AST Parsing**: Enhancing our ability to parse Terraform (HCL) and Kubernetes (YAML) structures.
* **Logic Mapping**: Implementing formal verification predicates for specific SOC2 and ISO 27001 controls.
* **CI/CD Integration**: Developing GitHub Actions and GitLab CI templates.

### 2. Documentation & Research
Led by **Sai Saketh Cherukuri**, we are documenting the mathematical foundations of our engine.
* Help us map technical configurations to regulatory requirements.
* Contribute to our **Research & References** wiki page.

### 3. Bug Reporting
If you find a security check that yields a "False Positive," please open an **Issue** with a snippet of the code and the expected result.

## Our Process
1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. Ensure your documentation is clear (we love **Docs-as-Code**).
4. Submit a **Pull Request**.

## Community Standards
We use **GitHub Discussions** for all architectural debates and Q&A. Please join us there to discuss major changes before starting work.
