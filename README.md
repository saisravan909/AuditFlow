# Welcome to AuditFlow 🚀
**The open-source engine that turns complex compliance requirements into living documentation.**

AuditFlow is designed for high-growth engineering teams who are tired of manual spreadsheets. By integrating directly into your CI/CD pipeline, we ensure your security posture is always audit-ready.

## The Challenge
Enterprise and Federal teams spend thousands of hours manually updating compliance spreadsheets (SOC2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP). By the time an auditor sees the documentation, it is often outdated because the infrastructure has already changed. This creates **Audit Risk** and **Developer Burnout**.

## Our Solution
AuditFlow is a **Docs-as-Code** pipeline that treats compliance like a unit test. It scans your Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions) and auto-generates a human-readable "Compliance Readiness" site.

* **Always Current:** Your documentation is rebuilt every time you push code.
* **Evidence-Based:** Generates automated proof for auditors directly from technical configurations.
* **Zero Friction:** Fits into existing DevOps workflows.

## Key Features (Planned)
* **Multi-Cloud Scanning:** Support for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud patterns.
* **Framework Mapping:** Pre-built templates for SOC2, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP.
* **Visual Evidence:** Interactive architecture diagrams via Mermaid.js.
* **Audit Portal:** A clean, searchable static site output.

## How it Works
1. **Analyze:** AuditFlow scans your repository for security patterns (e.g., `encryption_at_rest = true`).
2. **Verify:** It matches these patterns against specific compliance controls.
3. **Publish:** It generates a professional documentation site that acts as your "System Security Plan" (SSP).

## Roadmap
We are currently in the **Alpha Phase**. Our goal is a stable V1.0 by late 2026.
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Core CLI & Keyword Scanning (In Progress)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** GitHub Action Integration & SOC2 Mapping
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Visual Architecture Generator
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Enterprise Plugin System

## Contributing
**We are looking for technical partners!** AuditFlow was founded with a strong product vision, and we are now seeking DevOps engineers and Security Architects to help build the scanning engine.
